# Disassembler Explorer
Inspired by [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/), the Disassembler Explorer is a tool that lets people explore compiled software for any architecture!
Using Objdump, this tool is designed to help people learn assembly for any architecture that is compatible with GNU tools.

## Roadmap
- Get the tool working! 
    - Letting the user configure objdump exactly the way he wants it
    - Make objdump disassemble the file the way it was asked to
    - Display the raw output
- Syntax higlighting for ARM
    - Given how complex each instruction sets are, each architecture will be implemented one by one, starting with ARM
    - Helpful description of each instruction that explains exactly what's happening
- Syntax highlighting for other architecture
- Live assembly editing
